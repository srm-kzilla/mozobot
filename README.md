## Forking this repo üö®

Many people have contacted us asking if they can use this code for their own projects. The answer to that question is
usually "yes", with attribution. There are some cases, such as using this code for a business or something that is
greater than a personal project, that we may be less comfortable saying yes to. If in doubt, please don't hesitate to
ask us.

We value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. We spent a non-negligible amount
of effort developing, designing, and trying to perfect this iteration of our project, and we are proud of it! All we ask
is to not claim this effort as your own.

So, feel free to fork this repo. If you do, please just give us proper credit by linking back to our
website, https://srmkzilla.net. Refer to this
handy [quora post](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-bad-to-copy-other-peoples-code) if you're not sure what to do. Thanks!
